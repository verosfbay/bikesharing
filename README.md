# Bikesharing Visualization

## Purpose
The purpose of this visualization is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. I will analyze the data using Tableau Public. 

### Tools Used
* Tableau Public
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas

Showing the most popular stations in the city for ending a bike journey. The most popular station has the coordinates 40.7519, -73.9777. 

## Summary
The results showed that the most popular starting station and the most popular ending station are the same. There is not a big difference in checkout times as it relates to gender. The most popular day and time for bike trips is Thursday between 5-6pm. Monday and Tuesday 5-6pm follow in second. Looking at the subscribers, males take a lot more trips than female subscribers, Thursday being the most popular day for them, and Friday following in second. 

The two additonal visualizations I would suggest for future analysis are: Customer Type, to see the ratio of customers to subscribers, and Bike Utilization, to see which bikes are being used most often and may be in need of repairs. Customer Type would allow stakeholders to plan their marketing activities in regards to target users, and Bike Utilization would allow stakeholders to keep an aye on the most popular bikes, to make sure they don't break down before they need to be replaced.
